Routes  -> /courses -> all the courses
        -> /courses/courseId -> specific course
        
CRUD Test with Postman -> Everything is working.

I had problems with the frontend, it isn't sending the form data to the backend, but it's creating the course in the database.

I used MongoDB Atlas, as Database.      

I hope you like it.
